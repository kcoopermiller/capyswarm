# Collaborative Wordle Agents

This example demonstrates how to create collaborative AI agents that work together to solve Wordle puzzles more efficiently. Two agents play separate Wordle games simultaneously and share their knowledge to narrow down the possible solution space faster than a single agent could.

## Running the Example

1. Set up your environment:
   ```bash
   export SCRAPYBARA_API_KEY="your_api_key"
   ```

2. Run the example:
   ```bash
   uv run examples/wordle/run.py
   ```
